# Big-DataSession15-Assignment1
Scala Program Session II

Task 1
Create a Scala application to find the GCD of two numbers

Task 2
Fibonacci series (starting from 1) written in order without any spaces in between, thus
producing a sequence of digits.
Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.
➢ Write the function using standard for loop
➢ Write the function using recursion

Task 3
Find square root of number using Babylonian method.
1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the root, the better).
2.Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
b) Set y = n/x
